Warning message:
In valid.GenomicRanges.seqinfo(x, suggest.trim = TRUE) :
  GRanges object contains 1 out-of-bound range located on sequence chr17.
  Note that only ranges located on a non-circular sequence whose length
  is not NA can be considered out-of-bound (use seqlengths() and
  isCircular() to get the lengths and circularity flags of the underlying
  sequences). You can use trim() to trim these ranges. See
  ?`trim,GenomicRanges-method` for more information.
