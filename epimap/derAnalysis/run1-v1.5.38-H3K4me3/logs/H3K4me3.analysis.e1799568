Warning message:
In valid.GenomicRanges.seqinfo(x, suggest.trim = TRUE) :
  GRanges object contains 1 out-of-bound range located on sequence chr17. Note that only ranges located on a non-circular sequence whose length is not NA can be
  considered out-of-bound (use seqlengths() and isCircular() to get the lengths and circularity flags of the underlying sequences). You can use trim() to trim
  these ranges. See ?`trim,GenomicRanges-method` for more information.
