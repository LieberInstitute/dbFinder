WARNING @ Thu, 28 Apr 2016 01:26:06: #2 Since the d (145) calculated from paired-peaks are smaller than 2*tag length, it may be influenced by unknown sequencing problem! 
WARNING @ Thu, 28 Apr 2016 01:26:06: #2 You may need to consider one of the other alternative d(s): 2,145 
WARNING @ Thu, 28 Apr 2016 01:26:06: #2 You can restart the process with --nomodel --extsize XXX with your choice or an arbitrary number. Nontheless, MACS will continute computing.
